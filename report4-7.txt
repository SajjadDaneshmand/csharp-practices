csharp syntax:
1. Case sensitivity: lower case and upper case variable are different with each other. it means: int a = 3; int A = 4; => a and A are not a same variable
2. at end of each line, we should add ;
3. our code should be in a open end close currly brucket ({})
4. we can't define same variable with two value in a one block ({}): string a = "sajjad"; string a = "Ali" 
5. when we do some operation on a variable like Addition or subtraction in a few line, changes will be added to last line.

variables:
1. they saved into a ram and when your program ends, the variable will be remove
2. all variables type separated in two groups. 1: simple type 2: complex type
	simple data type: int, string, bool, double
		note: double = float in python
3. define variable syntax: Type Name = Value;
4. we can define variable without give a value to them. for example:
	> int a; // it get a default value(0)
	> a = 10
	note: if you define variable without value and use of that, the system give you an error
5. define two or more value in one line:
	> int a, b, c;
6. Complex data type consist of several simple data types
7. to convert data type to each other:
	1. import system: > using system
	2. Convert.to* // * means every you want
		note: default int is int32 (we have int16, int32 and int64)
