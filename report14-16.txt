partial classes:
when you define class as partial you can define it again and again in other files or in a same file. and when we build that project, classes will be merged
note:
in partial classes, we can't define same method
for example:
file: partialfile1.cs
partial class Operation
{
    static int sum(int num1, int num2)
    {
        return num1 + num2;
    }
}

file: partialfile2.cs

partial class Operation
{
    static string sum(int num1, int num2)
    {
        string finalStr = "final num is: " + (num1 + num2);
        return finalStr;
    }
}

ATTENTION: THIS IS WRONG BECAUSE WE HAVE TOW METHOD WITH SAME NAME!!!
