static:
when we set static for variable or method, they will be public and accessible without creating instance of that class
for example:
    class AirPod
    {
        public int port;
        public bool hasTwo;

        public AirPod(int port, bool hasTwo)
        {
            this.port = port;
            this.hasTwo = hasTwo;
        }

        public string Detail()
        {
            if (this.hasTwo)
            {
                return $"this air pod box has two airpod and it has {this.port} ports";
            }
            else
            {
                return $"this airpod hase {this.port} ports";
            }
        }

        public static string whatDoThis()
        {
            return "This class return details of the airpods";
        }
    }

inheritance: like python
for example:
    class child:parent
    {
        YOUR CODE
    }

properties:
when define new variable, it has two property. set and get. by default, you can set value or get that from variable but actually you can customize it
usage:
    class TestProperty
    {
        private int _number = 0;
        public int Number
        {
            get
            {
                return _number;
            }
            set
            {
                _number = Value
            }
        }
    }
